subtitle: Mapping health where people, animals & environment meet. 
description: | 
I investigate how human mobility, climate change and health weave togetherâ€”and how digital data can help us see those threads in real time. By pulling signals from smartphones, satellites and on-the-ground stories, I map both the risks and the often-overlooked benefits that movement brings to people and places. My goal is to turn these multidimensional insights into practical guidance for clinicians, planners and communities: evidence that accounts for gender, equity and our changing planet, and that supports smarter, more humane decisions about travel, migration and global health.
