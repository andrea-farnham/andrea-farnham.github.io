We describe a use-case for using **R** package **Data Tables** to render
an HTML table with metadata and use **Quarto** to publish it into a
website hosted in **Gitlab pages.** This enables researchers to share
metadata and navigate through metadata. The back-end encourages
researchers to use *version control* repositories for their metadata.
This is a fully flexible workflow, with minimal coding requirements or
additional dependencies.
