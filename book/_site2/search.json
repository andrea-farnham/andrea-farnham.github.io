    "text": "Back\nThis Tutorial is a short step-by-step guide on using Git and Gitlab and provides a workflow to use Github Desktop to sync with local files. For complete beginners we recommend the Git book, which is very accessible but also very detailed. It is available in several languages and as pdf. Another option for beginners are the Gitlab tutorials by Gitlab.com (commercial).\nGit is a system to track changes in files, it is most often used to coordinate the work among several persons who access the files online on a server or sync them to their computer. The online use does not require any installation, local use is only possible after installing Git.\nGitlab.com and Github.com are commercial hosting services for version control with Git. The UZH instance of the open source Gitlab at Gitlab.uzh.ch is hosted by the UZH on servers owned by SWITCH, a non-profit foundation that has been established by the Swiss Federal Government. See https://www.zi.uzh.ch/en/staff/software-elearning/webplatforms/gitlab.html for more information.\nA Git repository is a set of folders and files with complete history and full version-tracking abilities, locally or on a server."

    "text": "For project owners\nOur remote Gitlab repository, which we access via the browser is now our main location of metadata, code and (some) data. But sometimes it is convenient to make our edits locally. Specially if we are data owners and want to edit and share a large number of files or code, we cannot do this easily in the browser. Recall that you need to install Git for this.\nIn Git, you can clone a repository to create a copy on your computer, that will be synchronized with your remote repository. Once cloned we can pull changes done in the remote repository (in the browser). If we have local changes and want to ‘send’ them to the remote we do: 1) commit and 2) push the local changes to remote. (??? what about add?)\nNOTE: if we fork a repository instead of cloning it, this will create a completely independent copy of the Git repository. Here, we need cloning so that our local changes can be synchronized and we don’t create duplicates of the repository."

See further documentation on integration with Gitlab\n\nSetup of Github-desktop for Gitlab\n\nDownload and install Github desktop\nIn your Gitlab project, get your personal access token (see above) and save it somewhere\nOn Github desktop go to File/Clone repository. Then enter the URL of your Gitlab repository (see the clone button) and a local directory name. For example:\n\nThen you will be asked for username and password. Your username is your Gitlab username (e.g., the name in your email address) and the password is the Token that you just created.\n\nNow your Local folder is linked to your Gitlab remote repository. You can check below how to pull, commit and push changes.\n\n\nEditing repository\nPull,commit and Push changes in the content of the repository. The workflow can get quite complex. Here we will ignore elements like branches to oversimplify it into the main steps:\n\nWork on your local repository, for example, create or edit code, update your metadata table, add new files [^1]\nOpen Github desktop. If you have several repositories, make sure you select the one you are currently working on or the one you want to update. It should detect the local changes done. If there are changes done remotely, but not locally, it willl prompt you to pull those changes (but here, beware there may be conflicts, which you shold be able to solve with Github but may complicate things).\nClick Commit ( you will need to write a brief description, e.g., ‘updated figures’). This will prepare your changes to be sent to the remote repository (‘origin’). If you edited multiple scripts, you can commit all changes at once or select specific scripts\nClick push to origin so that the changes are uploaded.\n\n[^1]: Gitlab is not intended as a large data storage. For the pages in this example we need to have the pictures we want to render in the repository. But sometimes we have many files in our local repository that we do not want to push to the online repository. For that we can use a plain text file in that directory and call it .gitignore. In that file we can have statements like ‘*.jpg’. Then Git will ignore all jpg files in the folder when pushing."

By static we mean that the user will just see whatever data is contained in the HTML of the site. Although it contains an interactive table, all users have access to the same data which they cannot modify (unlike in dynamic websites).\nThe website hosted using Gitlab pages is rendered with an [R Markdown] (https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) script, that uses the R DT package). The script creates an interactive page in HTML. Gitlab CI is used to run the R Markdown script automatically at each update (push) and render the site from the browser so that users do not need to install R or other programs to update the site."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Back\nContinuous integration (CI) refers to the process of automating the integration of changes made by different developers working in the code. In the context of using Gitlab pages as a data hub, the CI will integrating changes in the metadata table and/or images into the resulting HTML. That is, it will update our website so that it shows the last version of our metadata and include any change we want in its content. The advantage is that users do not require to install any software dependencies (like R) and changes can be implemented using the browser, from any computer.\nSimplifying this There are 2 main elements we need to set up for Gitlab CI:\n\n1. Gitlab Runner\nThis is the service that will execute whatever operation you want to do in your CI pipeline. In this case we will use a shared-runner that is supported by the UZH. We only have this if we have our gitlab repository as part of the UZH Gitlab. We can also use our own runners but that is more complicated and beyond the scope of this tutorial (see Gitlab official documentation)\nYou can enable the shared-runner in your repository Settings&gt; CI/CD &gt; Runners. If you are using the UZH Gitlab there should be an available runner listed on the Shared runners section\n\n\n\n2. The .gitlab-ci.yml file\nThis file defines a pipeline which will run every time we make a change in the repository. A pipeline can have one or multiple jobs defined by a script (see complete documentation (here)[https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/]. In the following example the pipeline has one job: rendering the website using R Quarto markdown files (see our tutorial on making a website with R quarto from scratch).\nThere are examples and Continous Integration templates of this file online. They all need an image of a software environment, some jobs defined by a script and some artifacts that are output files from the jobs. The example below uses an image from and it is nased on a template taken from Rocker, which is a project offering docker containers for R environments. Broadly speaking, we can think of a docker container as a light-weight virtual machine and of a docker image as a snapshot of a virtual machine, what defines its software contents.\nBelow we show and describe the following example:\nimage: rocker/verse:4.3\n\npages:\n  stage: deploy\n  before_script:\n   - R -e \"install.packages('quarto')\" \n   - R -e \"install.packages('kableExtra')\" \n   - R -e \"install.packages('DT')\"  \n   - mkdir -p public/SPring/Images\n   - cp _data/SPring/Images/* public/SPring/Images/   \n  \n  script:   \n   - cd _scripts\n   - R -e \"baseDir &lt;- getwd(); quarto::quarto_render('*.qmd')\"\n   - mv ./_site/* ../public/ \n  \n  artifacts:    \n    paths:\n    - public    \n     \n  only:\n  - master\n  interruptible: true\n\nImage\n\nThe first part loads a docker container image, similar to a snapshot of a virtual machine, which will define a software environment.\n\n\n\nPages\n\nWe define different stages (deploy is the main, but some tests stages are usually included as well).\nBecause our image did not include some R packages that we need, we install them in the before the script section. The following lines after installing packages are to create a new folder with copies of the pictures that will be rendered in the website, in the ‘public’ folder (see below, this is the folder where the website html needs to be stored).\nThen the script to actually do the job. First for convenience here we set the _scripts folder as our current directory. Then we run the R code using the R quarto package to build a website by using the command quarto_render indicating all .qmd files in the folder. In our case the .qmd contain text and code to read tables with metadata (see our tutorial on how to make a website with Quarto). The quarto_render() command will automatically create a _site folder with the website. If we change a table or the text in one of those files, this will run again and generate the site again.\nWe then move the content of the website to the public folder. This is necessary as Gitlab pages will only display the content of that folder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAlthough it is called ‘public’ it does not mean that the page will be publicly available. Gitlab allows pages in private repository so that only people with access can see the content.\n\n\n\nThe job artifacts are the outputs of the job. In this example, the website HTMLs rendered by quarto. We define the path where we want those outputs as the ‘public’ folder for it to work with Gitlab pages"
