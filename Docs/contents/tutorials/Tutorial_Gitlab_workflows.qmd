Here we present different scenarios in which researchers can use Git


# An overview of Git
This diagram summarizes the basic processes we will do with Git. We can do these using the command line or using a program with a Graphic User Interface.

# A single project or data source

Here we describe several scenarios in which there are **several** **researchers** working on separate analysis or features within the same project. They use the same source data but their scripts are **independent**. We assume that each researcher is the **main** contributor to a set of scripts for a given analysis, study or experiment within the main project.

## Multiple repositories

-   All project-related
-   The scripts project subfolder is a **clone of a remote repository**
-   Each researcher manages a **subfolder within the repository** and pushes/commit changes within that folder

#### Pros, Cons & Warnings

| ✅ One can manage permissions and share only the scripts related to one analysis or user.  The local clones can still be within the same project folder (see example 1 below)
| ⚠️  The different repositories should be preferably under a common git group/user, namely , the lab's Gitlab or Github. 
| ⚠️  Researchers may keep their local clones in their personal folders (outside project: see  example 2). In this case their internal collaborators or principal investigator will only be able to see their scripts through the repository , so changes should be committed regularly. 
| 🔻 If there are many users and analyses this can result in many repositories associated to a project 
| 

#### Folder tree

Example 1

``` {.markdown style="line-height: 1em"}
Project/              NAS folder accessible to all researchers       
├─ data
├─ outputs
├─ scripts        
│   ├─ researcher1*   [Cloned Git repository 1] 🌐
│   └─ researcher2    [Cloned Git repository 2] 🌐  
└─ ..

*subfolders may be named by analysis, experiment or study within the project
```

Example 2

``` {.markdown style="line-height: 1em"}
Project/              NAS folder accessible to all researchers       
├─ data
├─ outputs
└─ ..

researcher1/         Location may differ from that of the project     
└─ scripts            [Cloned Git repository 1] 🌐

researcher2/           
└─ scripts            [Cloned Git repository 2] 🌐
```

#### Workflow

Each researcher has completely independent repositories. Researchers may edit and create code directly in the main branch or creating development branches and then merging with the main.

##### Repository 1

```{mermaid}
%%{init: { 'theme': 'base', 'gitGraph': {'showBranches': true,'showCommitLabel': false}} }%%
gitGraph
  commit
  commit
  branch branch1
  commit
  commit
  checkout main
  merge branch1
  commit
```

##### Repository 2

```{mermaid}
%%{init: { 'theme': 'base', 'gitGraph': {'showBranches': true,'showCommitLabel': false}} }%%
gitGraph
  commit
  commit
  branch branch1
  commit
  commit
  checkout main
  merge branch1
  commit
```

## A single repository

-   All project-related files in one location accessible by all contributing researchers
-   The scripts project subfolder is a **clone of a remote repository**
-   Each researcher manages a **subfolder within the repository** and pushes/commit changes within that folder

#### Pros, Cons & Warnings

| ✅ All scripts in one place
| 🔻Risk of accidental intereference with someone your colleague's changes commits
| 🔻You can't share or manage access to only one researcher's scripts
| ⚠️ Researchers need to make sure they push and commit only their changes in their subfolders
| ⚠️Note  that naming script subfolders by author is not informative and can work for a project in development, but not for publishing (sharing with external collaborators)
| 

#### Folder tree

``` {.markdown .code-overflow-wrap style="line-height: 1em"}
#| code-overflow: wrap 

Project/              ~NAS folder accessible to all researchers~       
├─ data
├─ outputs
├─ scripts*           [Cloned Git repository] 🌐
│   ├─ researcher1 
│   └─ researcher2     
└─ ..


*subfolders may be named by analysis, experiment or study within the project
```

#### Workflow

The different researchers access the project folder and work within their folder. When they are done they and push their changes and commit them to the main branch of the project's repository

```{mermaid}
%%{init: { 'theme': 'base', 'gitGraph': {'showBranches': true,'showCommitLabel': false}} }%%
gitGraph
  commit
  commit
  branch researcher1
  commit
  commit
  checkout main
  branch researcher2
  commit
  commit
  checkout main
  merge researcher1
  merge researcher2
  commit

```
