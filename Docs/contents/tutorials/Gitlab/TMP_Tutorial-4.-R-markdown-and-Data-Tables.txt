\# Troubleshooting {.unnumbered}

### Column width adjustment

-   AutoWidth needs to be TRUE for width adjust in ColumnDefs to work
-   Even if you adjust width, if the title of the column (i.e., header in the table) is long, the minimum width will be that of the column name unless: (solving this? )

### Zero-based indexing in DT options

-   In the options of Data table you will use 0 to refer to the 1st column. E.g., `list(visible = FALSE, targets = c(5:ncol(metadata)-1)),` will hide columns from the 4th to the latst (you need to subtract -1 to ncols to find the last column index)

### Extensions of DT (e.g., search panes)

Refer to known issues on the different extensions
