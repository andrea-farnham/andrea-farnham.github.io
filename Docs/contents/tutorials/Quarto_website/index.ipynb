        "Sharing documents, code, data and outputs with collaborators or to a broader audience is an essential step towards a good scientific practice. A website that can be managed by researchers themselves seems the ideal platform for efficient sharing. If this depends on IT support for maintenance it will not be practical for routine use, but learning web-development imposes an unnecessary and unacceptable burden to a scientist's already heavy workload.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here we describe an approach that uses free, open-source tools which are also widely-used for analytic purposes (e.g., data handling, statistics and visualizations). Thus, the requirements for learning web-specific tools is minimal. Importantly, this approach can be integrated in a research group's routines to compile dynamic reports with documentation, code, analysis and outputs in a single-document. This makes each step easier to understand, facilitates troubleshooting and improves computational reproducibility [see CRS primer](https://zenodo.org/records/8354360)\n",

        "\n",
        "-   [Quarto](https://quarto.org/): it is multi-language tool to facilitate technical and scientific publishing. It is supported by Rstudio. In the quarto documents we will have text chunks (plain text with markdown syntax, see note below) and code chunks (written in R, but it can also be other languages). This is an evolution of [Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) with more functions, output options and more **better interoperability** between languages and environments. For the user, working with Quarto and Rmarkdown is quite similar, with some minor differences in syntax\n",
