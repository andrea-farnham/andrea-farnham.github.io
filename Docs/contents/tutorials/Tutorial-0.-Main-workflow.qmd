# A Gitlab workflow to data sharing {.unnumbered}

The `owner` of the data (e.g., a lab or a researcher) creates, maintains and controls access to a **main Gitlab repository** containing:

1.  **Metadata**
2.  **Data**, if applicable, e.g., raw images, thumbnail images etc.
3.  **Scripts to render** an HTML landing site, i.e. the Data Hub, which provides access to the data for collaborators.
4.  **Documentation** associated with the data in the **Wiki** of the repository. The markdown files composing the Wiki can be downloaded (they are physically stored in a separate repository) or they can be directly edited in the browser through the main repository.

The advantage of this Data Hub setup is that all material can be accessed by authorized `collaborators` through a browser: 

1.  The **Data Hub**, i.e. the landing page of the repository, provides interactive filtering capacities based on meta data and links to the available data. 
2.  The **main repository** to access and update, if necessary, the source metadata tables and data files
3.  The **Wiki** to access all related documentation such as protocols and SOPs. The Wiki is linked from the landing page and accessible and editable through the main repository.

NOTE FOR THE PICTURE: Write Data Hub and put it in the first line
