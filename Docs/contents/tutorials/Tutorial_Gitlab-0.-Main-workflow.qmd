# Gitlab Tutorial 0: A Workflow for Data Sharing with Gitlab pages {.unnumbered}

Here we propose to use Gitlab pages to host an easy-to-build website where we can share documentation, metadata and some data (e.g., preview images) of our projects. The website can be either public or private, requiring users to log in. We propose that this approach can be useful to improve the research workflow in many labs and projects, irrespective of whether they have a strong programming focus.

The series of tutorials in this website explain the different processes required for this workflow. They include step-by-step guides, templates, video demos and links intended for non-coders, as well as other tutorials for more advanced users.

The main requirements for this workflow are:

-   (Required) A Gitlab repository and basic familiarity with it\
-   (Required) A way of creating HTML pages: we propose R markdown templates
-   (Recommended) A Gitlab continuous integration script to allow updating the directly from the browser. We provide examples and templates.

## Simplified workflow

```

## Detailed workflow

The `owner` of the data (e.g., a lab or a researcher) creates and maintains a **main Gitlab repository** containing:

1.  **Metadata**
2.  **Data**, if applicable, e.g., thumbnail images
3.  **Scripts to render** an HTML landing site, i.e. the Data Hub, which provides access for collaborators. This can be done without web development skill using in R markdown or R Quarto markdown.
4.  **Documentation** associated with those data is collected in the **Wiki** of the main repository. The advantage of using the Wiki is that it can be directly edited in the browser by anyone with permissions. If needed, the markdown files with the wiki pages could be downloaded (they are stored is a separate repository).

The materials will have three URL locations, which can all be accessed through the main landing site (Data Hub):

1.  The **Landing page** shows interactive tables to navigate data and metadata the documentation and has links to the main repository and the wiki.
2.  The **main repository** to access the source metadata tables, data files and the code necessary to generate the Hub.
3.  The **Wiki** to access all relevant documentation to understand how the data was collected and preprocessed, such as protocols and standard operating procedures (SOPs). It should also have information about filenames, folder structures and how metadata are organized. It is also accessible through the main repository.

Any `user/collaborator` is given the landing page address and access credentials to it. From there they can access the three urls.
