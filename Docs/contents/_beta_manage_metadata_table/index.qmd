Any research project requires **tabular data** with essential information about subjects or objects, recording parameters and outputs. These tables often involve manual entries which require *validation* *checks* for errors and inconsistencies. Also we often need to combine separate tables according to common *key* variables, for example one table may describe subject demographics and another table list a record of files or scores per subject. Such *join* operations should be done programmatically rather than manually, for the sake of reproducibility.
This is facilitated by **dynamic reports** in which a report is generated with a script containing explanations, code and output. 

The following dynamic examples are generated with R Quarto. A very basic knowledge of R is recommended to better understand the code chunk and adapt them to own data.
