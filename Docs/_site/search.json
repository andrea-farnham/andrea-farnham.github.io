You can check below how to pull, commit and push changes.\n\n\nEditing repository\nPull,commit and Push changes in the content of the repository. The workflow can get quite complex. Here we will ignore elements like branches to oversimplify it into the main steps:\n\nWork on your local repository, for example, create or edit code, update your metadata table, add new files [^1]\nOpen Github desktop. If you have several repositories, make sure you select the one you are currently working on or the one you want to update. It should detect the local changes done. If there are changes done remotely, but not locally, it willl prompt you to pull those changes (but here, beware there may be conflicts, which you shold be able to solve with Github but may complicate things).\nClick Commit ( you will need to write a brief description, e.g., ‘updated figures’). This will prepare your changes to be sent to the remote repository (‘origin’). If you edited multiple scripts, you can commit all changes at once or select specific scripts\nClick push to origin so that the changes are uploaded.\n\n[^1]: Gitlab is not intended as a large data storage. For the pages in this example we need to have the pictures we want to render in the repository. But sometimes we have many files in our local repository that we do not want to push to the online repository. For that we can use a plain text file in that directory and call it .gitignore. In that file we can have statements like ‘*.jpg’. Then Git will ignore all jpg files in the folder when pushing."

    "text": "Back\n\nGitlab Tutorial 2: Creating and Updating a Data Hub\nThe static site generated in this repository shows an interactive table with image thumbnails (clickable). By static we mean that the user will just see whatever data is contained in the HTML of the site. Although it contains an interactive table, all users have access to the same data which they cannot modify (unlike in dynamic websites).\nThe website hosted using Gitlab pages is rendered with an [R Markdown] (https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) script, that uses the R DT package). The script creates an interactive page in HTML. Gitlab CI is used to run the R Markdown script automatically at each update (push) and render the site from the browser so that users do not need to install R or other programs to update the site.\n\n\nWorkflow for data owners\n\n\n1. ACTION: Owner edits metadata\nThe owner can do this through:\n\nBrowser (RECOMMENDED FOR MINOR CHANGES) Making changes from Gitlab in the browser (upload or edit file)\nClone repository (RECOMMENDED FOR MAJOR UPDATES) Cloning this repo, working locally and committing and pushing the changes to Gitlab (e.g., using Github desktop). The local metadata file should be always in Sync with that one in the remote repository.\n\nNOTE: The files in the Gitlab repository should be considered as the main source for retrieving your projects’ metadata.\n\n\n2. AUTO: changes in the repository trigger the Continuous Integration pipeline\nIt may take around 5 minutes to update the page html. The member with at least maintainer status can click on Build/Pipelines or Jobs (sidebar in Gitlab) to see what pipeline or job (within pipeline) is running, and if there are any errors.\n\n\n3. AUTO: the continuous integration pipeline runs the script\nThe .gitlab-ci.yml file defines this pipeline. It uses a Docker image with R, Gitlab pages to produce the website, and Gitlab runner to run the Docker where we have our Rmarkdown script (rendering the html from the table). The owner can edit the yml and the Rmarkdown to make if changes in this flow are to be done. No edit of Docker image is needed.\nSee our tutorial on customizing Gitlab Continuous Integration for more advanced details.\n\n\n4. AUTO: The HTML is updated and collaborators can navigate through the updated data\n\n\n\nFiles\nThe main input files are:\n\nmetadata table (preferrably in .csv format for interoperability). It should contain just the filename of the pictures that will be displayed\nimages files (Note: Gitlab is not meant for data storage. Images should be compressed to avoid exceeding volume allowed per repo ( usually 5 Gb in free versions, details here)\nR markdown script that has the code to render the table with DT package\nA .gitlab-ci.yml file is the Continuous integration file that makes it possible to run the Rmd file and render the html again from Gitlab\n\nThe outputs for the website\n\nindex.html file within the public folder\nAn ’ files’ folder will be saved if the table is rendered as self-contained\n\nNote: index.html and images folder ARE EXPECTED to be saved in the public folder. This does not mean they are publicly accessible (you need login to access this site)\n\n\nPrivacy\nThis is a private repository and a private site\n\nAccounts. A SWITCH account is required to access the static website and the repository with the code to generate it\nMembers. A maintainer member in this repository can add new members (Go to Manage/Members). They must be also maintainer to be able to access the images after clicking on the table thumbnail. Guests can only see the thumbnails\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

Then enter the URL of your Gitlab repository (see the clone button) and a local directory name. For example:\n\nNext you will be asked for username and password. Your username is your Gitlab username (e.g., the name in your email address) and the password is the token that you just created.\n\nNow your Local folder is linked to your Gitlab remote repository. You can check below how to pull, commit and push changes."

    "text": "Sharing documents, code, data and outputs with collaborators or to a broader audience is an essential step towards a good scientific practice. A website that can be managed by researchers themselves seems the ideal platform for efficient sharing. If this depends on IT support for maintenance it will not be practical for routine use, but learning web-development imposes an unnecessary and unacceptable burden to a scientist’s already heavy workload.\nHere we describe an approach that uses free, open-source tools which are also widely-used for analytic purposes (e.g., data handling, statistics and visualizations). Thus, the requirements for learning web-specific tools is minimal. Importantly, this approach can be integrated in a research group’s routines to compile dynamic reports with documentation, code, analysis and outputs in a single-document. This makes each step easier to understand, facilitates troubleshooting and improves computational reproducibility see CRS primer"
