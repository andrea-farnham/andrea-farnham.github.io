    "text": "2. Cloning a repository to local computer\n\nFor project owners\nOur remote Gitlab repository, which we access via the browser is now our main location of metadata, code and (some) data. But sometimes it is convenient to make our edits locally. Specially if we are data owners and want to edit and share a large number of files or code, we cannot do this easily in the browser. Recall that you need to install Git for this.\nIn Git, you can clone a repository to create a copy on your computer, that will be synchronized with your remote repository. Once cloned we can pull changes done in the remote repository (in the browser). If we have local changes and want to ‘send’ them to the remote we do: 1) commit and 2) push the local changes to remote. (??? what about add?)\nNOTE: if we fork a repository instead of cloning it, this will create a completely independent copy of the Git repository. Here, we need cloning so that our local changes can be synchronized and we don’t create duplicates of the repository.\n\n\nPersonal access token\nTo clone a repository to your machine you will most likely need a personal access token (due to the security of SWITCH login). In your project repository on Gitlab.uzh.ch go to Settings/Access tokens. In the Access Tokens menu you will be able to give the token a name, choose an expiration date (or leave it blank), choose permissions (choose at least developer for making edits) and scope (select API). See also the picture below.\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\nAfter this you will see a long alphanumeric string, the token, that you should save somewhere so you can use it as your password later on when using Github-desktop, Git or any other platform to manage local copies of the repositories."

See further documentation on integration with Gitlab\n\nSetup of Github-desktop for Gitlab\n\nDownload and install Github desktop\nIn your Gitlab project, get your personal access token (see above) and save it somewhere\nOn Github desktop go to File/Clone repository. Then enter the URL of your Gitlab repository (see the clone button) and a local directory name. For example:\n\nThen you will be asked for username and password. Your username is your Gitlab username (e.g., the name in your email address) and the password is the Token that you just created.\n\nNow your Local folder is linked to your Gitlab remote repository. You can check below how to pull, commit and push changes.\n\n\nEditing repository\nPull,commit and Push changes in the content of the repository. The workflow can get quite complex. Here we will ignore elements like branches to oversimplify it into the main steps:\n\nWork on your local repository, for example, create or edit code, update your metadata table, add new files [^1]\nOpen Github desktop. If you have several repositories, make sure you select the one you are currently working on or the one you want to update. It should detect the local changes done. If there are changes done remotely, but not locally, it willl prompt you to pull those changes (but here, beware there may be conflicts, which you shold be able to solve with Github but may complicate things).\nClick Commit ( you will need to write a brief description, e.g., ‘updated figures’). This will prepare your changes to be sent to the remote repository (‘origin’). If you edited multiple scripts, you can commit all changes at once or select specific scripts\nClick push to origin so that the changes are uploaded.\n\n[^1]: Gitlab is not intended as a large data storage. For the pages in this example we need to have the pictures we want to render in the repository. But sometimes we have many files in our local repository that we do not want to push to the online repository. For that we can use a plain text file in that directory and call it .gitignore. In that file we can have statements like ‘*.jpg’. Then Git will ignore all jpg files in the folder when pushing."

The script creates an interactive page in HTML. Gitlab CI is used to run the R Markdown script automatically at each update (push) and render the site from the browser so that users do not need to install R or other programs to update the site."

    "text": "Back\n\nWhy is this useful?\nWe can make use of the continuous integration (CI) feature in systems like Gitlab to increase interoperability and reproducibility. CI allows to use our Gitlab repository to run scripts directly in the web browser, without the need to download any software. For example, it allows to automatically update our website or data hub whenever a change in the repository is detected. Thus, different users can edit and conduct analysis in the same software environment and from the web-browser. This tutorial presents a simple use case of this feature.\n\n\nOverview\nContinuous integration (CI) refers to the process of automating the integration of changes made by different developers working in the code. In the context of using Gitlab pages as a data hub, the CI will integrating changes in the metadata table and/or images into the resulting HTML. That is, it will update our website so that it shows the last version of our metadata and include any change we want in its content. The advantage is that users do not require to install any software dependencies (like R) and changes can be implemented using the browser, from any computer.\nSimplifying this There are 2 main elements we need to set up for Gitlab CI:\n\n1. Gitlab Runner\nThis is the service that will execute whatever operation you want to do in your CI pipeline. In this case we will use a shared-runner that is supported by the UZH. We only have this if we have our gitlab repository as part of the UZH Gitlab. We can also use our own runners but that is more complicated and beyond the scope of this tutorial (see Gitlab official documentation)\nYou can enable the shared-runner in your repository Settings&gt; CI/CD &gt; Runners. If you are using the UZH Gitlab there should be an available runner listed on the Shared runners section\n\n\n\n2. The .gitlab-ci.yml file\nThis file defines a pipeline which will run every time we make a change in the repository. A pipeline can have one or multiple jobs defined by a script (see complete documentation (here)[https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/]. In the following example the pipeline has one job: rendering the website using R Quarto markdown files (see our tutorial on making a website with R quarto from scratch).\nThere are examples and Continous Integration templates of this file online. They all need an image of a software environment, some jobs defined by a script and some artifacts that are output files from the jobs. The example below uses an image from and it is nased on a template taken from Rocker, which is a project offering docker containers for R environments. Broadly speaking, we can think of a docker container as a light-weight virtual machine and of a docker image as a snapshot of a virtual machine, what defines its software contents.\nBelow we show and describe the following example:\nimage: rocker/verse:4.3\n\npages:\n  stage: deploy\n  before_script:\n   - R -e \"install.packages('quarto')\" \n   - R -e \"install.packages('kableExtra')\" \n   - R -e \"install.packages('DT')\"  \n   - mkdir -p public/SPring/Images\n   - cp _data/SPring/Images/* public/SPring/Images/   \n  \n  script:   \n   - cd _scripts\n   - R -e \"baseDir &lt;- getwd(); quarto::quarto_render('*.qmd')\"\n   - mv ./_site/* ../public/ \n  \n  artifacts:    \n    paths:\n    - public    \n     \n  only:\n  - master\n  interruptible: true\n\nImage\n\nThe first part loads a docker container image, similar to a snapshot of a virtual machine, which will define a software environment.\n\n\n\nPages\n\nWe define different stages (deploy is the main, but some tests stages are usually included as well).\nBecause our image did not include some R packages that we need, we install them in the before the script section. The following lines after installing packages are to create a new folder with copies of the pictures that will be rendered in the website, in the ‘public’ folder (see below, this is the folder where the website html needs to be stored).\nThen the script to actually do the job. First for convenience here we set the _scripts folder as our current directory. Then we run the R code using the R quarto package to build a website by using the command quarto_render indicating all .qmd files in the folder. In our case the .qmd contain text and code to read tables with metadata (see our tutorial on how to make a website with Quarto). The quarto_render() command will automatically create a _site folder with the website. If we change a table or the text in one of those files, this will run again and generate the site again.\nWe then move the content of the website to the public folder. This is necessary as Gitlab pages will only display the content of that folder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAlthough it is called ‘public’ it does not mean that the page will be publicly available. Gitlab allows pages in private repository so that only people with access can see the content.\n\n\n\nThe job artifacts are the outputs of the job. In this example, the website HTMLs rendered by quarto. We define the path where we want those outputs as the ‘public’ folder for it to work with Gitlab pages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Why is this relevant?\nSharing documents, code, data and outputs with collaborators or to a broader audience is an essential step towards a good scientific practice. A website that can be managed by researchers themselves seems the ideal platform for efficient sharing. If this depends on IT support for maintenance it will not be practical for routine use, but learning web-development imposes an unnecessary and unacceptable burden to a scientist’s already heavy workload.\nHere we describe an approach that uses free, open-source tools which are also widely-used for analytic purposes (e.g., data handling, statistics and visualizations). Thus, the requirements for learning web-specific tools is minimal. Importantly, this approach can be integrated in a research group’s routines to compile dynamic reports with documentation, code, analysis and outputs in a single-document. This makes each step easier to understand, facilitates troubleshooting and improves computational reproducibility see CRS primer\n\n\nSoftware required\nAll these tools are free and open source\n\nR: a widely-used software environment for statistical computing and graphics\nRstudio: an interactive development environment to use for working with R. It includes a visual editor and essential features to facilitate code editing.Importantly it supports Quarto (see below)\nQuarto: it is multi-language tool to facilitate technical and scientific publishing. It is supported by Rstudio. In the quarto documents we will have text chunks (plain text with markdown syntax, see note below) and code chunks (written in R, but it can also be other languages). This is an evolution of Rmarkdown with more functions, output options and more better interoperability between languages and environments. For the user, working with Quarto and Rmarkdown is quite similar, with some minor differences in syntax\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDictionary\n\n\n\nSome terms that often pop up if you search for documentation on the tools above:\n\nIDE: interactive development environment, this is an application that help us develop code more efficiently. They have features like syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, debugging tools, etc.\nMarkdown: it is a markup language, that is, a set of symbols inserted in a text document to control structure, formatting and how its parts relate to each other. Markdown syntax is very simple and easy for humans to read. It allows us to write stuff in plain-text in a way that can be transformed into formatted text by other tools.\nPandoc: this is a program integrated in R studio that renders markdown text into other output formats like pdf, html word , etc)\nKnitr: this is the engine that executes the code chunks in a Quarto or Rmarkdown document. It can be installed as a package in R\nyaml or yml: YAML is a human-readable language used for configuration files. Here we use a .yml file to configure our site and a yml header to add settings and metadata on top of each quarto file\n\n\n\n\n\nFiles needed\nAt least you will need the following:\n\nA _quarto.yml configuration file (required filename & extension)\nAn index.qmd quarto markdown (suggested filename)\n\n\n\nStep-by-step shorts\nAssuming you have installed RStudio and quarto\n\n1. Make a website from scratch in 5 minutes\nThis 5 minutes video shows how easy it is to create the basic skeleton of the website.\n\nStep 1. Make a new folder for your website\nInside the folder you will have the _quarto.yml file at the top level, then you can organize the quarto markdown files with the content in subfolders if you want.\n\n\nStep 2. Create a _quarto.yml file with some settings\nThey are given in plain text. Indentation counts. There are many examples online which would require minimal adjustments. A very simple example:\nproject:\n    type: website\n    \nwebsite:\n    navbar:\n        title: Home\n        \nformat: \n    html:\n        author: Center for Reproducible Science\n“navbar” indicates a navigation bar on top of the website, but you can also define a “sidebar”. In there you can refer to the different pages that will make up your site. In this example we just make an skeleton with the home page.\n\n\nStep 3. Create a quarto file and open it in R studio\nWe recommend creating an R project file in Rstudio to point at your web’s folder and open your quarto files with that project open in Rstudio to avoid having future problems finding the path to your files.\nYou can write plain text with markdown syntax on it and use a yml header delimited by --- symbols to add metadata or settings\n\n\nStep 4. Click render\nThat’s it. A new subfolder named _site will be created with a file index.html which is your website\n\n\n\n\n2. Add pages and lists of pages within your website\n\n\n3. Host it for free using Gitlab pages\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
